Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used.

(4, 'Think Java: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist', 'This is the fifth edition of a book I started writing in 1999, when I was\r\nteaching at Colby College. I had taught an introductory computer science\r\nclass using the Java programming language, but I had not found a textbook\r\nI was happy with. For one thing, they were all too big! There was no way my\r\nstudents would read 800 pages of dense, technical material, even if I wanted\r\nthem to. And I didn’t want them to. Most of the material was too specific—\r\ndetails about Java and its libraries that would be obsolete by the end of the\r\nsemester, and that obscured the material I really wanted to get to.\r\nThe other problem I found was that the introduction to object oriented\r\nprogramming was too abrupt. Many students who were otherwise doing well\r\njust hit a wall when we got to objects, whether we did it at the beginning,\r\nmiddle or end.\r\nSo I started writing. I wrote a chapter a day for 13 days, and on the 14th\r\nday I edited. Then I sent it to be photocopied and bound. When I handed it\r\nout on the first day of class, I told the students that they would be expected\r\nto read one chapter a week. In other words, they would read it seven times\r\nslower than I wrote it.', 'Allen B Downey', 'http://localhost:8090/e-bookshop/uploads/file/Think-Java-How-to-Think-Like-a-Computer-Scientist_(1).pdf', '', 1, '2019-04-12 14:27:22'),

To mention a few, the business \r\norganizations that produce goods or services, hospitals, religious and \r\nsocial institutions like charities, schools, colleges and universities. All these \r\norganizations exist to achieve pre-determined objectives. They affect our \r\nlives in many ways. Though there are vast differences in their functioning \r\nand approaches, they all strive to achieve certain objectives. It must also \r\nbe noted that organizations cannot achieve the objectives effortlessly. \r\nThey are achieved through systematic effort. Several activities have to be \r\nperformed in a cohesive way. In the absence of systematic and cohesive \r\nperformance of the activities to achieve the objectives, it is no wonder that \r\nthe resources of organizations would be underutilized. As such it is the \r\nfunction of the management to facilitate the performance of activities such \r\nthat the accomplishment of the objectives becomes possible.', 'Srinivas R Rao', 'http://localhost:8090/e-bookshop/uploads/file/Management-and-Organization-Behavior.pdf', '', 5, '2019-04-12 14:29:18'),

It will benefit students studying computer science and physical sciences, who plan to teach mathematics in schools, or to work in industry or finance. The book assumes that the reader has a solid background in linear algebra. For the first 12 chapters elementary operations, elementary matrices, linear independence and rank are important. In the second half of the book abstract vector spaces are used. Students will need to have experience proving results. Some acquaintance with Euclidean geometry is also desirable. In fact I have found that a course in Euclidean geometry fits together very well with the algebra in the first 12 chapters. But one can avoid the geometry in the book by simply omitting chapter 7 and the geometric parts of chapters 9 and 18. \r\n\r\nThe material in the book is organized linearly. There are few excursions away from the main path. The only significant parts which can be omitted are those just mentioned, the section in chapter 12 on P SL(2, Fp), chapter 13 on abelian groups and the section in chapter 14 on Berlekamp\'s algorithm.', 'John Scherk', 'http://localhost:8090/e-bookshop/uploads/file/Algebra-_A_Computational_Introduction.pdf', '', 1, '2021-05-04 06:27:18'),
(8, 'Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python', 'This book was originally written as a set of lecture notes to the book A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python by Hans Petter Langtangen1, and can be used either as a supplement to that book or on its own, as a compact introduction to scientific programming. Langtangen\'s book and these lecture notes, have formed the core of an introductory course on scientific programming at the University of Oslo (INF1100/IN1900, 10 ETCS credits). The course has been running since 2007 and is primarily taken by first-year students of mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, and geosciences. \r\n\r\nThe writing of these lecture notes, and their subsequent evolution into a book, were primarily motivated by two factors. The first was that many students found the nearly 1000 pages of Langtangen\'s book a bit overwhelming as a first introduction to programming. This effect could be mostly psychological, since the book is well structured and suited for selective study of chapters and sections, but the student feedback from students still indicated the need for a more compact and (literally) lightweight introduction. The second factor was that, sadly, Hans Petter Langtangen passed away in 2016, and his book has therefore not been updated to the newest versions of Python and the various tools introduced in the book. This issue could also be mostly a mental obstacle, since the differences between the Python versions are quite small, and only minor edits are needed to make most of the examples from the original book run on the newest Python platform. However, the book is intended as an introduction to programming, and when learning an entirely new topic, any minor inconsistency is a potential source of confusion. I therefore saw the need for an updated document where all the code examples would run without any modifications on the most common Python platforms. That said, in spite of these minor shortcomings as an introductory text, Langtangen\'s book is still an excellent resource on scientific programming in Python. Compared with the present book, it covers a much broader set of topics and includes more examples, more detailed discussions and explanations, and many more useful programming hints and tips. I highly recommend it as a supplement to these notes for anyone with ambitions to become an expert scientific programmer.', 'Joakim Sundnes', 'http://localhost:8090/e-bookshop/uploads/file/2020_Book_IntroductionToScientificProgra.pdf', '', 13, '2021-05-04 06:57:16'),

However, the instructors and students are still in search of\r\na comprehensive textbook that integrates computing theories and information technologies with the\r\ndesign, programming, and application of distributed systems. This book is designed to meet these\r\ndemands. The book can be also used as a major reference for professionals working in this field.\r\nThe book addresses the latest advances in hardware and software, system architecture, new programming\r\nparadigms, and ecosystems emphasizing both speed performance and energy efficiency. These latest\r\ndevelopments explain how to create high-performance clusters, scalable networks, automated data\r\ncenters, and high-throughput cloud/grid systems. We also cover programming, and the use of distributed\r\nor cloud systems in innovative Internet applications. The book aims to transform traditional multiprocessors\r\nand multi-computer clusters into web-scale grids, clouds, and P2P networks for ubiquitous use in\r\nthe future Internet, including large-scale social networks and the Internet of things that are emerging\r\nrapidly in recent years.', 'Kai Hwang', 'http://localhost:8090/e-bookshop/uploads/file/Distributed_and_Cloud_Computing-_From_Parallel_Processing_to_the_Internet_of_Things_-_October_2011.pdf', '', 1, '2021-05-04 07:11:26');
